Space Discordianism Refined
===========================

This is not about discordianism, because it is about space discordianism.

Very important point:
* Handle the data with care
* Make love to the meta

All resources here are channeled into issues. So if you actually came here for
finding information which actually is not here, you will have to look at the
issues list:
https://github.com/c-base/discord/issues

If your hubris and/or pineal gland is large enough, you can try submitting new
issues:
https://github.com/c-base/discord/issues/new

Reason
======

No need for a reason. But we thought, Discordianism isn't actually fit for
space, because who would want to go to space, anyway. So now we fix things that
aren't really broken, for the sake of Meta. And getting into space. We really
like space.

Who
===

We make meta data porn:

* Pope 'riot' the indecisive
* Mope 'lilly' the forgetfulness
* Pope 'jeedi' the has-to-add-his-pope-name-here
